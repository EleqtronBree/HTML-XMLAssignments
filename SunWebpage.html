		<hr>
		<p>
			Many people think the sun is yellow. 
			However, the spectrum of its light (how much of each wavelength is present) implies it is actually white! 
			So, why do we think it is yellow? Here are some ideas:
		</p>
		
		<!-- Ordered list of reasons why the sun is yellow !-->
		<ol>
			<li>
				We see the sun most often at sunset, when it is low on the horizon. 
				Its light passes through more air which scatters away the red wavelengths. 
				So the sun does look more yellow in this situation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Official photos of the sun are often coloured orange.
			</li>
			<li>
				Children like to draw pictures which include the sun. 
				Since it's boring to leave it white, we encourage them to colour it yellow. 
			</li>
